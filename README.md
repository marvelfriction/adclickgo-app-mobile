# DOCUMENTATION FOR ADCLICKGO MOBILE APP
This project is built using React Native Expo.

## Conventions and guidelines

-   Ensure to follow the file naming structure
-   Ensure not to disable any eslint rules
-   Default exports are not allowed, only `named exports`
-   All new task must be done on a new branch checked out from `develop` branch
-   Branch Naming convention ( `lowercase, no spaces, no special characters` ) :

          feature --- ft-{{feature_name}}
          bug --- bg-{{bug_name}}
          update --- ch-{{update_name}}
          hotfix --- hf-{{hotfix_name}}

-   Commit Message convention ( `give it a chore name in the present tense` ) :
          "chore: add new page"

-   Ensure to update your branch by pulling `develop` branch on your branch after you have completed your task and resolve conflicts.
-   Ensure to create a PR against `develop` branch and not staging nor main

-   Route Path Name convention ( `should use kebab case` )
